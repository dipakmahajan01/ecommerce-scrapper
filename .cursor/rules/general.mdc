- For any function that takes three or more arguments, use a single options object as the parameter instead of passing arguments positionally.
- Only write comments when essential for understanding the code or for explaining complex logic; avoid unnecessary or redundant comments.
- Always ensure type safety. Rewrite any code using the 'any' type to use proper, explicit, and safe types. Do not use 'any' in type definitions or variable declarations.
